    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: October 31, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to our mobile applications (the “Application”), provided as a free download with
      optional subscription plans. The Application is provided “AS IS.”</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application does not require users to sign in and does not store personal data on external servers. All data
      created in the Application is stored locally on your device. You have full control over your data and may export
      or import it manually where supported.</p>

    <p>The Application may use certain third‑party services that automatically collect limited information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>App usage data such as screens viewed, time spent, and crash reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used only for analytics, debugging, and improving app performance. The Application does not
      collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or contact details.</p>

    <h2>Location Information</h2>
    <p>The Application does not collect or use precise location data. Some third‑party analytics services may infer an
      approximate location based on IP address for aggregated analytics purposes only.</p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application may use third‑party services for analytics, crash reporting, or in‑app purchases. These services
      may collect information used to identify you indirectly (for example, via device identifiers) and are governed by
      their own privacy policies. No personal user data or app content data is shared by the Application with these
      services.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Export</h2>
    <p>All application data is stored locally on your device. You may export or import your data at any time where
      supported. The developer does not have access to or store your personal app data.</p>

    <h2>Opt‑Out Rights</h2>
    <p>You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. You may also limit third‑party analytics
      collection using your device settings (for example, by disabling analytics or ad tracking).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is protected by your device’s security features such as encryption and screen lock. Any limited data
      shared with third‑party services is transmitted securely and handled according to their respective privacy
      policies.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Application after any changes
      constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
