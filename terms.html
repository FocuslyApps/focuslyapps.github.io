    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: October 31, 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the mobile applications, websites and
      related services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by the developer. By downloading, installing, or using
      any of the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

    <h2>1. License</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
      revocable license to use the Services for personal, non-commercial purposes on compatible devices.</p>

    <h2>2. Updates & Availability</h2>
    <p>The developer may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue the Services (or any features) at any time without
      prior notice. The developer does not warrant continuous availability or compatibility with future device or
      operating system releases.</p>

    <h2>3. Data & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Services may use third-party providers (for analytics, crash reporting, hosting, or payments) that collect
      device-level or usage information. The developer does not control those providers’ practices. For details about
      how data is handled, please refer to the app-specific Privacy Policy where provided.</p>

    <h2>4. Purchases, Subscriptions & Refunds</h2>
    <p>Paid features (if any) are offered through the platform’s in-app purchase system (for example, the Apple App
      Store). All purchases and subscriptions are subject to the platform provider’s terms and billing policies. Refunds
      and billing questions are handled by the platform provider; consult their support for account or refund requests.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the Services lawfully and responsibly. You must not use the Services to transmit unlawful,
      harmful, or infringing content. The developer may remove or disable access to content or accounts that violate
      these Terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in the Services (including design, graphics, code, and content provided by the
      developer) are owned by or licensed to the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, create derivative
      works from, or reverse engineer the Services except as permitted by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer
      disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular
      purpose. In no event will the developer be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
      damages arising from your use of the Services.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer and its officers, agents, and partners from any claims,
      losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Services
      or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>The developer may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including
      violation of these Terms. Upon termination you must stop using the Services and delete any copies of the software
      as required by the developer.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>The developer may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are material we will provide notice in the
      Services or update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Services after a change constitutes acceptance of
      the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer’s location, to the extent permitted by applicable law. If
      any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms or about the Services, please contact us.</strong></p>
